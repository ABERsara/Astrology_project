Astrology Insights Platform
This project is a comprehensive web application that offers users a seamless and engaging experience in the realm of astrology. Built using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, with MongoDB as the database, the platform ensures secure and efficient handling of user data, utilizing technologies like Redux Toolkit Query, Express.js, and JWT for authentication. The UI/UX design was meticulously crafted in Figma by a specialist, ensuring an intuitive and visually appealing interface.

Overview of Features
The platform is designed to cater to three types of users: administrators, registered users, and guests, each with specific capabilities.

Homepage and Core Functionalities
The homepage serves as the entry point to the platform, featuring a visually appealing zodiac wheel. Users can click on their zodiac sign to access tailored astrological insights. The homepage also highlights three featured blog posts and allows guests to explore general information about astrology and the platform’s astrologer. Guests can register seamlessly from any page and return to their current activity.

User Roles and Interactions
Guests can:

View up to three recommended blog posts.
Learn about astrology and the astrologer behind the platform.
Select their zodiac sign on the wheel for insights.
Register at any point and retain their current session.
Registered Users enjoy a more personalized experience, allowing them to:

The Blog model tracks posts, comments, and user interactions such as favorites.
The Analysis model stores personalized astrological reports linked to specific users.
UI/UX Design
The interface was designed with a focus on accessibility and user engagement. The design process involved multiple iterations in Figma to ensure a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing experience. Clear navigation, responsive layouts, and intuitive interactions define the platform’s usability.
